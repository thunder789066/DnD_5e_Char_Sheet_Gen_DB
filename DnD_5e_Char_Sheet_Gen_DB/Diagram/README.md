# ER Diagram(s)

This is Wes, beacuse of the scope of this project and the large number of tables and relations I broke up the creation of the ER diagram into smaller parts. Then different teammates took the ER diagrams and created the schema / imported the data. To help my own understanding I gave a layout of my understanding of what I thought the schema would look like and some test Excel data as well to double-check my understanding of the relations

Christrina took charge of Race / Subrace and all those relations

Britt designed the tables for Backgrounds and her and Wes filled in the data together

Wes designed the Class tables (Not Spells) and filled the data for all them

Christria designed the Spell table and filling the data

Wes added all empty tables for the sake of creating the Schema diagram
